Space Station Object Detection using YOLOv8
Using synthetic data from Duality AIâ€™s Falcon digital twin, we built a high-performance object detection model for critical tools in a space station environment.
We trained and fine-tuned a YOLOv8 model using synthetic data of space station tools (toolbox, fire extinguisher, oxygen tank) under varied conditions such as lighting, occlusion, and angle. The final model achieved a high mAP@0.5 and robust class-wise performance. Visualizations, confusion matrices, and failure analysis are included.
